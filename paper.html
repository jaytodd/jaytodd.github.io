<h1>Dollar Tree Website:</h1>
    <p>
    Dollar Tree: The Dollar Tree Website is in need of a lot of improvement. The first thing that stands out as really ugly is their execution of the green and white color scheme. Many of the fonts are different colors for no reason and the font types are inconsistant. When analyzing the website, the most egrigious thing I encounterd was being unable to visit their site due to "scheduled maintenece." I was stuck on a boring screen with a detour sign clip art and four lines of text all with different fonts and font colors. It is reasonable to assume that the site is often not working especially since I could not access their site for hours. This website stands out due to its nauseating color scheme and design choices. The code also looks very elementary, being disorganized and having many elements blank such as the header. The layout does not make sense to me considering there many different confusingly labeled links that bring you to different shopping options. These shopping links are also intermingled with links to their blog, videos, advertizements, and othere less significant pages. The photos they chose do not complement eachother and are very boring. The navigation is also confusing because there are two links for shopping but they take you to a different shopping page. Many of the links I entered left me at a dead end where I had to press back since the header with important links dissapears. The use of color on this website is abbysmal. They use their logo colors: green, white, and yellow, but destroy any symmetry these colors have by intermixing dark red, lots of blue, and a plethora of non-contrasting colors in the photos on the website. When someone designed this website they must have been thinking that more colors and more stimulation will create a better result. Since the website is cluttered and aesthetically unpleasing it gives off an energy of being cheaply made. The website looks cheap which is much like dollar tree products, but I still don't find it effective in marketing toward low income individuals. I felt no desire to shop at dollar tree after browsing their website and believe they could have made the site significantly more striking, especially with a few design and color changes.

        Adobe: On the opposite side of the spectrum from Dollar Tree, Adobe has a very well crafted website that is full of life and motion. My favorite part about the website is all the motion integrated into the website. Text is only present where it is nesessary and it is always emphasised with moving images. Despite the multitude of gifs on the site, it loaded extremely fast and immideately started playing a video that communicates what Adobe strives to accomplish. The code on the site is very well organized with different levels to help group related elements. Despite a lot occuring on the website, the code script is short and looks very efficient. The layout makes a lot of sense to me since the fixed header has all the links you would want to press if you were interested in purchasing a subscription or even maintaining your current subscription. The video playing on the front page is very inticing and overall the design is very simple. The header contains the most useful links and the rest of the website is made up of well spaced out general information about the creative cloud service. Also, every link that you hover over has an effect such as changing color or bulging which I believe improves the design of the page significatnly. Navigating the page is also very easy. you can access most of what you need by scrolling from the home page or you can click on links and be directed to an even less cluttered page with more detailed information on the topic. Although it uses a complicated pallet, I really like the color scheme. Orange, red, green, blue, yellow, and pink are all used. The website uses white space very well and it contrasts well with the rainbowlike color scheme used in the moving animations on the rest of the site. What makes this website stand out among others is the effects. Certain links and pictures will enlarge when you hover over them and it brings the page to life. There is also a very nice use of curves on all the buttons. They use rounded buttons for purchasing options that stand out against the other options. This website was aimed at graphic designers and it shows. When looking at the website I felt inspired to learn a lot more about how to use photoshop.

    Apple has a very well crafted website and has many features that make it stand out from your average website. What I like most about this website is the use of simple design and negative space. I also find it very impressive that they managed to pack a ton of information onto a simple site while making it feel like there is not too much going on. The codeing on the site is extremely modern and well organized. there is a ton of actions occuring but the code is kept precice and efficient. The layout of the website is perfect. The homepage is extremely simple and organizes their most popular products at the center of attention. If you want to navigate to a particular product, you are sent to another page that is equally well set up and very aesthetically pleasing. When researching a particular product on the website, the site page has all the information you could want easily accessable. They do a great job of maximizing the content in a small workspace. Navigation is very intuitive since you can access every crucial category from the fixed header at the top of the screen. Every category of product is self explanitory and provides all the information you could  want on the category. I think apples color usage stands out among the other websites I have reviewed. Apple has always expertly achieved a professional look with their signiture colors of black and white and space grey. Throughout the whole website there is a constant contrast of black and white which accomplishes a very professional ambiance. Overall, I like apples use of blank space. Some links being enveloped by the surrounding white helps emphasise the importance of other links that are boardered by the signiture, deep, glossy black shading that apple uses. I think apple has been at the top of website design for a long time now. They always manage to make their color composition and designs look fresh, relevent, and increasingly quality.
