				<h2>#1 <i>Seinfeld</i></h2>
                <p><i>Sienfeld</i> Is a legendary show written by Jerry Sienfeld. Every episode of <i>Seinfeld </i>is exceptionally clever and the characters make the comedy halarious. The show manages to make simple things such as washing hands or waiting in line very funny through observational humor. Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David are masters of observational humor and did a good job making people laugh about every day inconveniences.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>#2 <i>Friends</i></h2>
                <p><i>Frends</i> is a beloved show that stars a loveable cast of characters who are all now extremely famous. <i>Friends</i> is often considered one of the best comedies which is understandable due to the fact that it makes people feel good after watching it. The characters are extremely quirky and they all bring some form of comedy to the table whether it be idiocy, cluelessness, or sassyness. I have not watched much <i>Friends,</i> but it can't be ignored as one of the best comedy shows.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>#3 <i>The Office</i></h2>
				<p><i>The Office</i> is one of the most watched sitcoms, especially today. The office is very clever and relatable, taking place in a common office, and documenting the lives and relationships of the employees. <i>The Office</i> has a very uniqe style of humor that makes it stand out as an amazing comedy.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>#4 <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm,</i></h2>
				<p>Larry David's <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> is one of my personal favorites and demonstrates the comedic prowess of Larry David. In this show, Larry David lives every day life and ends up having an existnetial battle with every social rule that he is forced to follow while interacting in the world. <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> is a very clever show that consistantly keeps me laughing.</p>
				<br>                <h1><b>Honorable Mention</b>: <i>Arrested Development</i></h1>

				</div>
				<p><i>Arrested Development</i> Is a lighthearted comedy that is extremely funny mostly due to how crazy the main characters are and the situations they get themselves into. Everyone is an exaggerated stereotype of a rich family member. With a large fortune to be divided up eventually, the Bluth Family is constantly bickering and plotting ways to get themselves into a lucrative will.</p>
