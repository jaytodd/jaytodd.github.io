				<h2>#1 <i>Breaking Bad</i></h2>
				<p>Breaking bad is an intense drama about a high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with lung cancer and decides to start making and selling meth. Despite insisting his intentions are pure, Walter White slowly turns more and more into a coldhearted drug kingpin. He wants to leave his family with money before he dies but ultimately ends up causing everyone he loves great pain.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>#2. <i>The Wire</i></h2>
				<p><i>The Wire</i> is often said to be the greatest TV show of all time. It is about a criminal who beats a case for murder. After winning in court the main character is given the opportunity and decides to lead a narcotics and homicide team with the goal of taking down a drug kingpin in Baltimore. This series is experty written and the acting is phenomenal making it a strong cannidate for the #1 or #2 spot.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>#3 <i>The Sopranos</i></h2>
				<p><i>The Sopranos</i> Is a crime Drama that revisits the life of Tony Soprano as a mafia leader who tries to balance his position with raising a family. This show is extremely intriguing. It is always suprising and has amazing dialogue. </p>
				<br>
				<h2>#4 <i>Dexter</i></h2>
				<p><i>Dexter</i> is a twisted crime drama about an expert homicide detective who also commits murders. Being a murderer himself helps him solve a lot of mysteries and creates a rich plot that portrays an ordinary person despite the viewer knowing that he is a psychopath.</p>
				<br>
				<h1><b>Honorable Mention</b>: <i>Better Call Saul</i></h1>

				</div>
				<p>Myself being a big fan of <i>Breaking Bad</i>, the TV show <i>Better Call Saul</i> fits comfortably into this list. The show is very good and builds off of <i>Breaking bad</i> extremely well. It follows the character Saul, who is a struggling lawyer willing to do anything to prove himself as worthy to himself, his brother, and his friends. A main theme in the show that resonats especially well with me is the idea that sometimes people seen as heros can be bad people, but good people might do some bad things in order to do a greater good.</p>
