    <h1>Favorite:Iowa. The website for Iowa is very well laid out. It has everything I would reasonably want to explore directly on the front page including Job listings, travel information, and outdoor activities. the website is simple without too much information on it. It is very aesthetically pleasing, loads quickly and is easy to navigate.</h1>

    <h2>My second favorite state site is for Vermont. I think the design is extremely good on this website for example the separating of links with large and full pictures that are visually pleasing and catch the eye. all of the information I would need is easy to access wether I am a resident or tuorist in Vermont. The most essential links are locked at the top of the website including "government" and "explore." Having a search bar as the center of attention is very nice also since any information you could not navigate to from the margins would be easy to type in. I like the layout on this website more than Iowa but the reason I did not choose it as the best is because it takes a while for my computer to loadi the site. This is probably due to them using a lot of pixels in their pictures in addition to a lot of them.</h2>

    <h3>My third favorite website is for Oklahoma. This website is pretty simplistic, it loads very quickly, and the design looks good. having said that I think this website is significantly worse than the website for Iowa and Vermont. Personally, there is nothing I would want to click on after going to this website. There is far less information to navigate to on this website and is very short. There is no option to explore or find activities or general information about Oklahoma. An Oklahoma resident woul find this website useful if they are renewing their drivers licence or hunting license. The design of this website is nice but the content is lackluster.</h3>

    <h4>My fourth favorite website is for Tennessee. This website has some really good content but the disign is not the best. on the starting page there is a lot going on with an auto changing panel showing different information on Coronavirus. It is pretty easy to get to everything I could want which I can not say about the website for Oklahoma. You can explore the state, find education, careers, and even access their social media accounts from the website. For the design, they chose red white and blue with star themes to go with their flag. This makes sense and looks pretty good but one thing I did not find aesthetically pleasing was the orange underliners used for the links on the page. I also think it could benefit from more uniformity. One section of the homepage uses photoes for links, another section has boxes, and another has just words. having said that I think the calander on the front page is a great idea and communicates a lot of relevent information.</h4>

    <h5>My least favorite website is for Alaska. My biggest problem with this website is that it looks outdated. It has large margins with a single layout that does not change while accessing it on a mobile device. There are a lot of internet graphics as placeholders for links and the only photos are generic ones of a mountain. The information present on the front page is more relevent than what the Oklahoma website listed but it is crammed and requires some searching with the crusor to find the correct links to click on. For an old website it looks pretty good but by todays standards, the Alaska website needs a major design rework.</h5>
