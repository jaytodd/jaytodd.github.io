    <p>During the Fall, many trees lose their leaves and the weather starts getting colder. After an active summer, its better to stay out of the rain and focusing on cooking or playing games with friends and family. going to the pumpkin patch is a good idea, as well as finding a trail with a lot of colorful trees.</p>
