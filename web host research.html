If I were to choose a web host provider I would choose Godaddy. I think this is the best choice because it bundles thing together in a way that makes even their economically friendly plans very good options with everything you would need for a website. If I was running a massive business I would choose Bluehost since it offered lots of professional services. Godaddy is good for personal or very small business' websites.
